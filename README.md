- when a piece reaches the opposite end of the board it is promoted to queen
- a queen can move any number of free tiles, in any directions
- when on a green tile, a piece can warp to the other side of the board
- when multiples takes in a row can be made, they are mandatory
- (TBD) when a player can take a piece, he must do so

at the end of the game, the scoreboard (local) will aprear:
- enter the name of the winner
- press [enter]
- enter the name of the looser
- press [enter]
scores are then saved.  
if you enter the same name with a better score, you will overwrite older one (logical, I know)

## Scores
pray the eldritch gods to be favored by the uptruce algorithm

## How to install?
